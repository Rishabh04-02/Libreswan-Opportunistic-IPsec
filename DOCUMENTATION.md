### wget
It can be downloaded from [here - debian/ubuntu](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-wget-togetrid-of-error-bash-wget-command-not-found/) OR [here - RHEL/CentOS 7](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/yum-install-wget-redhat-cetos-rhel-7/)

### certbot
It is required to generate certificates (only if you are using the script for the server side). It can be downloaded from [here](https://certbot.eff.org/)

## Installation

1. clone the [project repository](https://github.com/Rishabh04-02/Libreswan-Opportunistic-IPsec.git) using the following command:
` git clone https://github.com/Rishabh04-02/Libreswan-Opportunistic-IPsec.git`

2. Go to the project directory using the following command:
 `cd Libreswan-Opportunistic-IPsec`

 3. Run the setup file:
 `sudo bash setup`
 When you run the setup file it'll ask for: *Installing for server or client? Type (S/C)*. Choose your response accordingly.

## Scripts available
Note - OE refers to Opportunistic Encryption.

1. `setup`

This script is the main script which is to be run when installing the project for the first time. This script performs the following tasks:
* Check if IPsec is installed.
* performs the 1st time server/client Installation.
* Checks for existing OE connections.
* Downloads the LetsEncrypt CA and intermediate certificates.
* Initializes the NSS database and import the LetsEncrypt certificates in it.
* Saves the default client/server configuration.
* Restarts IPsec to load the latest changes.
* Establishes the OE connection.
* Checks for the success in establishing the OE connection.
* Displays OE connection status to user.

2. `import_certificates`
* This scripts imports the custom certificates into the NSS database.
* Save the certificates PKCS#12 (.p12) file in the `certs/custom` directory. The script will import all the certificates available in the directory.

3. `custom_configuration`
* This script allows user to create custom configurations and run IPsec with them.
* The script loads the configuration from `config/custom` directory and saves it as the default configuration.
* After saving the configuration the script restarts IPsec and establishes an OE connection.
* It also displays the connection status to user.

4. `create_connection`
* This script checks for existing OE connections. Restarts IPsec if any existing OE connection found.
* After that it establishes a new OE connection.
* Displays the connection status to user.
