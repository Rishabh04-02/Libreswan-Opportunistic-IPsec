1. IPsec -  [Libreswan](https://github.com/libreswan/libreswan/)
2. curl
3. certutil
4. wget
5. certbot
6. openssl

## Installation

Follow these [Installation instructions](https://github.com/libreswan/libreswan/blob/master/README.md#compiling-the-userland-and-ike-daemon-manually-in-usrlocal)

## Available [arguments]
Note - To get the list of all the acceptable arguments run `ipsec letsencrypt -h` OR `ipsec letsencrypt help`

> setup --client, setup --server, test, generatecertificate, updatecertificate, help, -s --client, -s --server, -t, -gc, -uc, -h

## Functions of various [arguments]
Note - OE refers to Opportunistic Encryption.

1. `ipsec letsencrypt setup --client` OR `ipsec letsencrypt -s --client` OR `ipsec letsencrypt setup --server` OR `ipsec letsencrypt -s --server`

For initial setup, it is to be run when installing the project for the first time. This [argument] performs the following tasks:
* performs the 1st time server/client Installation.
* Checks for existing OE connections.
* Downloads the LetsEncrypt CA and intermediate certificates.
* Initializes the NSS database and import the LetsEncrypt certificates in it.
* Saves the default client/server configuration.
* Restarts IPsec to load the latest changes.
* Establishes the OE connection.
* Checks for the success in establishing the OE connection.
* Displays OE connection status to user.
