## Features Implemented so far [NEEDS UPDATION]

1. The script can only be run as root.

> The script checks if it is run as root or not. It is essential as to make changes in /etc/ipsec.d the script need root privileges.

2. The script checks if IPsec is installed.

> If not installed, the script exits after showing prompt with various available ways to install IPsec.

3. Script downloads the letsencrypt certificates CA and intermediate certificates.

> If the script fails to download the certificates then it exits. Showing the error status. The possible reason for its failure was not running the script as `root` but that is fixed now.


4. Script saves the downloaded certificates in `certs` directory.

> If the script is run once then the certificates are downloaded in the `certs` directory. But if one tries to redo the whole process(i.e. in case the certs are expired.), the old certs are deleted and new ones are downloaded.

5. Script on repeated running (i.e. in case the certs are expired.) replaces the old configuration and certs and with the new updated certs and default configuration.

6. The Script initializes the nssdb if not initialized before.

7. The downloaded CA and intermediate certs are imported in the nssdb.

8. The script adds the server/client configuration to /etc/ipsec.d based on the user preference.

> The user is asked, if he is Installing for server or client?

9. After performing all the above steps, script restarts the ipsec service.
