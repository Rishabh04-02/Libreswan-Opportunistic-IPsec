# Libreswan-Opportunistic-IPsec
> Libreswan Opportunistic IPsec using LetsEncrypt

`letsencrypt` invokes any of several utilities involved in controlling the Opportunistic Encryption system, running the specified {command} with the specified [argument] as if it had been invoked directly.

e.g. `ipsec letsencrypt -h` lists the available commands.

It is a [program](https://github.com/Rishabh04-02/libreswan/tree/master/programs/letsencrypt) in [libreswan](https://github.com/libreswan/libreswan/), which integrates libreswan with Opportunistic Encryption utilities. The script provides various OE functionality e.g. initial OE setup, testing configuration/connection, generating and updating Let's Encrypt certificates. The details about the utilities and using them can be found in the [Documentation](https://github.com/Rishabh04-02/Libreswan-Opportunistic-IPsec/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md)
